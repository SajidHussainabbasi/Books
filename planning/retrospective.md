## Retrospective – Books

### What Went Well
- Successfully integrated with the Open Library API for real-time book data
- Clean project structure using modular folders: `api-calls`, `handlers`, `listeners`, `components`
- Search functionality worked smoothly via both button click and Enter key
- Displayed key book details: title, author(s), cover image, and publication year
- Simple and responsive design worked well on both mobile and desktop screens

### What Can Improve
- No loading feedback shown during API fetch; users may feel nothing is happening
- Error handling could be more informative for empty inputs or no results
- Only the first book result is shown — could extend to support multiple results
- Design could be more visually appealing with better color schemes or animations
- Accessibility features (e.g. keyboard navigation, screen reader support) need improvement
